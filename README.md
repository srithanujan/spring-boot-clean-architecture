## :hammer: Features

This system was based on the [requirements document](https://github.com/vinimrs/A3/blob/main/requisitos.pdf) proposed by the professor during the course.

- `Feature 1` `Users management`:  The system allows a super user (administrator) to manage (CRUD) all users of the system, such as rental companies and customers.
- `Feature 2` `Bikes rental`: The system allows customers to rent bicycles at a certain date from rentesCompanies available in the system.
- `Feature 3` `Browsing without login`: The system provides interfaces for non-logged in users to be able to use the system without a registration.
- `And more...`.
